To test, 
Run GraphiQL and visit endpoint http://localhost:8080/graphql?
with the following graphql query
query  {
	readFile(
		filename: "Canada"
	)
}
To test graphql mutation
mutation {
	createNewFile(
	  filename: "Australia",
	  text: "hello from Australia",
	)
}

mutation {
	addToFile(
	  filename: "Australia",
	  text: "a major city is Melbourne",
	)
}

Or using a browser with the following http request
query
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={readFile(filename:"Japan")}

mutation
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=mutation{createNewFile(filename:"France", text:"The capital is Paris")}
http://http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=mutation{addToFile(filename:%22France%22,text:%22A%20major%20city%20is%20Bordeaux%22)}

These commands are also available from other machines pointing to the ipv4 or ipv6 address of the server, for example:
query
http://[ipv6address]:8080/graphql?query={readFile(filename:"Mexico")}

mutation
http://[ipv6address]:8080/graphql?query=mutation{createNewFile(filename:"Spain", text:"The capital is Madrid")}
http://[ipv6address]:8080/graphql?query=mutation{addToFile(filename:%22Spain%22,text:%22A%20major%20city%20is%20Barcelona%22)}
